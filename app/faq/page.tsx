    question: "How does the IRIS AgroOS system work?",
    answer: "IRIS AgroOS uses a network of IoT sensors (temperature, humidity, gas, flame, ultrasonic) connected to ESP32 microcontrollers. These devices collect real-time field data and transmit it via WiFi to our secure cloud backend. The web dashboard then displays this data with intelligent alerts and AI-powered recommendations for optimal farming decisions.",
  },
  {
    question: "Does the system require internet connectivity?",
    answer: "Yes, internet connectivity is required for real-time data transmission and cloud synchronization. However, the ESP32 modules can store data locally during brief connectivity interruptions and sync automatically when the connection is restored. We recommend a stable WiFi connection with at least 1 Mbps upload speed for optimal performance.",
  },
  {
    question: "How are sensor alerts generated?",
    answer: "Alerts are generated based on predefined thresholds and AI analysis. For example, temperature above 35°C triggers a warning, gas levels above 300ppm indicate danger, and flame detection immediately activates emergency protocols. You can customize these thresholds from the dashboard settings based on your specific crop and environmental requirements.",
  },
  {
    question: "Is IRIS AgroOS affordable for small farmers?",
    answer: "Absolutely! We designed IRIS AgroOS with affordability in mind. The basic sensor kit costs around $50-100 for hardware, and our software platform offers a free tier for small farms (up to 5 sensors). Premium features like AI insights and advanced analytics are available through affordable monthly subscriptions starting at $9.99/month.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can small-scale farmers use this system effectively?",
    answer: "Yes, IRIS AgroOS is designed to scale from small backyard farms to large commercial operations. Small farmers can start with just 2-3 essential sensors (temperature, humidity, soil moisture) and expand as needed. Our mobile-friendly dashboard makes it easy to monitor your farm from anywhere, even without technical expertise.",
  },
  {
    question: "How is my farm data secured?",
    answer: "We take data security very seriously. All sensor data is encrypted in transit using TLS 1.3 and at rest using AES-256 encryption. API keys and sensitive credentials are stored securely on our backend servers - never in the frontend code. We are GDPR compliant and never share your farm data with third parties without explicit consent.",
  },
  {
    question: "What sensors are compatible with the system?",
    answer: "IRIS AgroOS supports a wide range of sensors including DHT11/DHT22 (temperature/humidity), MQ2/MQ135 (gas detection), HC-SR04 (ultrasonic distance), flame sensors, soil moisture sensors, light sensors, and pH sensors. We also support integration with third-party weather stations and commercial agricultural sensors via our open API.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can I integrate IRIS AgroOS with my existing farm equipment?",
    answer: "Yes, our platform supports integration with various farm management systems and equipment through our REST API. We offer pre-built integrations for popular irrigation controllers, weather stations, and farm management software. Our team can also develop custom integrations for specialized equipment upon request.",
